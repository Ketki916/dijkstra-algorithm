# dijkstra-algorithm

This code implements the Dijkstra algorithm to find the minimum distances from a source node to any other node in an
undirected weighted graph. The input is an adjacency list that is assigned to an adjacencyList variable and the output
is a list of minimum distances to each node (except source node) in order. The input must be directed typed in code.
